Hi! My name is Zhaoshu Yu (余兆舒 in Chinese). I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in Applied Physics at Tongji University. In the latter half of this year, I shall commence doctoral studies at Tongji University's School of Computer Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. [Jingkuan Song](https://jingkuansong.github.io/index.html).

My research interests focus on Vision-Language-Action Models, Embodied AI and Multimodel Learning.

# 🔥 News
- *2025.10*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 We release [A Survey on Efficient Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24795), the first comprehensive survey specifically dedicated to efficient Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, providing an in-depth coverage of the entire model–training-data pipeline.
